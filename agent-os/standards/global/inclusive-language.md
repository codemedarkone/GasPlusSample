# Inclusive Language

Use respectful, inclusive, professional language across **code, UI, and docs**.

- Avoid terms with historical trauma or bias.
- Use gender‑neutral pronouns for hypothetical people (`they/them`). 
- Don’t gender non‑human entities (modules, servers, clients).
- Avoid slang and culture‑specific idioms in user‑facing strings.
