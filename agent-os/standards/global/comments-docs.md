# Comments & Documentation

- Prefer **self‑documenting code** with clear names.
- Write **useful comments** that explain *why*, not just *what*.
- Document non‑obvious preconditions, invariants, and ownership.
- Keep comments up to date; delete stale commentary.
- Public APIs: brief summary above declaration; longer rationale in `.cpp` if needed.
